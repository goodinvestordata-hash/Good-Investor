          <li>
            SEBI Registration: Registration granted by SEBI and certification

          <li>
            Risk Associated with Open Positions: Our recommendations may be
            open; we may not provide any stop-loss or target price in securities
            recommendations. This will cause a huge loss on your portfolio in
            adverse market conditions, company events or any event that may
            impact market movement.
          </li>
          <li>
            Technical Risk: Algorithmic trading systems depend on technology,
            including internet connectivity, server uptime, broker APIs, and
            third-party software. Any failure, delay, or malfunction in these
            components may result in unintended trades or losses.
          </li>
          <li>
            Operational Risk: There is a risk that the algorithm may not
            function as intended due to bugs, logic errors, incorrect parameter
            settings, or misinterpretation of market data. Manual intervention
            may be required at times, especially in extreme conditions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Regulatory and Broker Compliance: All users must ensure that their
            algorithmic activities comply with SEBI rules, exchange guidelines,

            violation of margin norms can result in penalties or suspension.
          </li>
          <li>
            Discretion and Responsibility: Users must understand that executing
            trades based on signals or algorithms is at their own discretion. It
            is your responsibility to assess suitability based on your financial
            condition, risk tolerance, and trading knowledge.
          </li>
          <li>
            No Fiduciary Duty: The service provider does not act as a portfolio
